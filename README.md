# usebrick/platform

> **AI agents forget your architecture. Every session starts fresh.**
> usebrick.dev fixes that by making your repository's structure explicit
> and machine-readable — so Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Aider follow
> your patterns instead of reinventing them.

**Monorepo for the [usebrick.dev](https://usebrick.dev) platform.** Home of the `slopbrick` CLI, the `@usebrick/core` Repository Structure spec, the pure-function `@usebrick/engine`, and the marketing site.

## What is usebrick?

usebrick is a four-product platform for the **Repository Structure Platform** (RSP) — a versioned, cross-language data model for the structure of a codebase. The four products revolve around one noun: **structure**.

| Product | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **PickBrick** | Defines the **intended** structure (the Constitution) | planned |
| **SlopBrick** | Discovers the **actual** structure (the scanner) | **shipped** as `slopbrick@0.21.0` on npm |
| **MendBrick** | Repairs the structure (the migrator) | planned |
| **LockBrick** | Protects the structure (the enforcer, in CI) | planned |

The user reads the model as:

```
Repository
  ├── Constitution (desired structure)
  ├── Inventory (observed structure)
  ├── Structure (agent-readable summary)
  ├── Health (quality of structure)
  └── History (how structure evolved)
```

usebrick is **not** an LLM-memory product. It does not embed code, does not chat, does not RAG. It is **deterministic analysis** — every output is reproducible from the input source files plus a calibration dataset.

One-sentence positioning: **"BRICK continuously discovers and maintains your repository's structure."**

---

## Quick start (for users)

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -D slopbrick

# 2. Initialize (8 quick questions about your stack)
npx slopbrick init

# 3. Scan (writes .slopbrick/ artifacts)
npx slopbrick scan

# 4. Optional: start the MCP server so Claude Code / Cursor can
# consume the artifacts
npx slopbrick mcp
```

That's it. The next time an AI agent writes a file in your repo, it reads `.slopbrick/structure.md` instead of re-parsing the AST. **100–1000× faster** on the agent integration, and the agent's first suggestion matches what the project already uses, not what the LLM trained on.

**This isn't CLAUDE.md.** CLAUDE.md is a static file the agent reads once per session. `.slopbrick/structure.md` is a generated artifact that updates on every scan — your repository, encoded for the next agent.

For a CI gate, see [`packages/slopbrick/EXAMPLES.md`](./packages/slopbrick/EXAMPLES.md#strict-ci-gate).

---

## The 4 .slopbrick/ artifacts

Every `slopbrick scan` writes four atomic artifacts (and one cache file at the project root). Together they form the **Repository Structure** — a structured summary that downstream consumers (MCP tools, CI gates, dashboards, future usebrick.dev tools) read **instead of re-parsing the AST**.

```
<project-root>/
├── .slopbrick/
│   ├── inventory.json     # detected patterns + component fingerprints
│   ├── constitution.json  # declared stack (mirrors slopbrick.config.mjs)
│   ├── health.json        # 4-score model + per-severity issue counts
│   └── structure.md       # agent-readable markdown summary
└── .slopbrick-cache.json  # per-file mtime + hash (NOT in public schema)
```

| Artifact | Purpose | Schema |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `inventory.json` | Detected patterns + component fingerprints | [`v1/inventory.schema.json`](./packages/core/schemas/v1/inventory.schema.json) |
| `constitution.json` | Declared project allow-list + deny-list | [`v1/constitution.schema.json`](./packages/core/schemas/v1/constitution.schema.json) |
| `structure.md` | Agent-readable markdown summary | [`v1/structure.schema.json`](./packages/core/schemas/v1/structure.schema.json) |
| `health.json` | Per-scan 4-score snapshot | [`v1/health.schema.json`](./packages/core/schemas/v1/health.schema.json) |

**This is the moat.** If these schemas become a de-facto standard for "repository structure," every tool in the ecosystem speaks the same language. The versioned path (`schemas/v1/`, future `schemas/v2/`) is the contract version. Older tools keep reading `v1/` after `v2/` ships. Backward-compatible changes never bump the schema version — only add new optional fields with defaults.

---

## The 4-score model (v0.21.0+)

The single `slopIndex` is replaced by **4 independent scores** (all 0-100):

| Score | What it measures | Direction | CI gate? |
|-------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **`aiSlopScore`** | AI-slop signatures (16 `ai/*` rules). Raw amount of slop detected. | **lower = cleaner** (0=clean, 100=saturated) | **Yes** (`≤ meanSlop: 30` passes) |
| **`engineeringHygiene`** | Average of 6 category scores: arch, logic, layout, visual, component, test | higher = better | No (informational) |
| **`security`** | AI Security Risk band: low=100, medium=67, high=33, critical=0 | higher = better | No (informational) |
| **`repositoryHealth`** (composite) | Weighted: `0.4 × (100 − aiSlopScore) + 0.3 × eng + 0.2 × sec + 0.1 × test` (inverts `aiSlopScore` internally) | higher = better | No (informational) |

**v0.21.0 score-direction flip:** in v0.15.0–v0.20.1, `aiSlopScore` was
the inverted "cleanliness" reading (100 = no slop). That triggered the
natural-reading confusion: "AI Slop Score: 100" reads as "100% slop".
v0.21.0 flips the field to the **raw amount** (lower = cleaner), matching
the natural reading of the name. The composite `repositoryHealth`
inverts internally so the dashboard headline stays "higher = better".
See [`packages/slopbrick/CHANGELOG.md`](./packages/slopbrick/CHANGELOG.md)
for the full migration checklist.

**Why 4 scores, not 1:** The legacy `slopIndex` conflated AI-specific findings with engineering hygiene. Two repos could both score 70/100 for completely different reasons — one had AI drift, the other had pattern fragmentation. The 4-score model lets users see the actual problem.

The legacy `slopIndex` field is kept as optional on `ProjectReport` for backward compat with existing test fixtures and historical telemetry; the v0.14-compat removal is tracked separately.

---

## v0.15.0 — what's new

v0.15.0 is a **hard-break release** that ships the full v0.15.0 plan:

- **Rebrand**: "Repository Memory Platform" → **"Repository Structure Platform"**. The on-disk artifact `.slopbrick/memory.md` is now `.slopbrick/structure.md`. Types renamed: `MemoryFile` → `StructureFile`, `loadMemory` → `loadStructure`, etc.
- **Engine extraction**: `packages/engine/` is a new workspace package containing the pure scanning logic (parser, scoring, LR combiner, structure persistence). No I/O, no `console.log`, no `process.exit`. Reusable from CLI, MCP, and future web IDEs.
- **Multi-score model**: The single `slopIndex` is replaced by 4 independent scores: `aiSlopScore` / `engineeringHygiene` / `security` / `repositoryHealth` (composite). (Originally `aiQuality` in v0.15.0; renamed in v0.21.0 when the field was flipped to the natural-reading "raw amount of slop" direction.)
- **Engine/UI taxonomy seam**: The engine's 6 verdict taxonomy (USEFUL/OK/NOISY/INVERTED/HYGIENE/DORMANT) is decoupled from the user-facing 3-bucket taxonomy (AI Findings / Engineering Hygiene / Suppressed) via `bucketForVerdict()`.
- **Schema codegen**: JSON Schemas are now the single source of truth; TypeScript types are codegen'd from them. CI fails if schemas and types drift.
- **Website hardening**: Skip-to-content link, keyboard-accessible tool cards, axe-core a11y in CI, `LowPowerDetector` to skip WebGL on low-power devices, LCP-swap for WebGL initialization.
- **slopbrick CLI slimmed** from 1469 to 451 lines (69% reduction) by extracting report generation into `packages/engine/`.

See [`packages/slopbrick/CHANGELOG.md`](./packages/slopbrick/CHANGELOG.md) for full release notes.

## Packages

| Package | Status | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `slopbrick` | **published** | The flagship CLI. `npx slopbrick scan`, `npx slopbrick drift`, `npx slopbrick security`. 4-score model, 60+ rules, MCP server, migrate subcommand. |
| `@usebrick/core` | `private: true` — workspace-only | Types + JSON Schemas + readers/writers + verdict taxonomy for the Repository Structure Platform. **Not published to npm** until the schema stabilizes (need at least 2 consumers writing/reading the schemas in production). |
| `@usebrick/engine` | `private: true` — workspace-only (new in v0.15.0) | The pure scanning engine extracted from slopbrick. No I/O, no console.log, no process.exit. Reusable from CLI, MCP, future web IDEs. |
| `@usebrick/website` | `private: true` — workspace-only | The [usebrick.dev](https://usebrick.dev) marketing site. Astro + Lenis + GSAP, full-bleed WebGL brick shader hero, click-to-break tool cards, axe-core a11y in CI. Built to `dist/` and deployed to Cloudflare Pages. |
| `@usebrick/mcp` | (future) | Standalone MCP server exposing all the slopbrick tools as a library. |
| `@usebrick/sdk` | (future) | Programmatic SDK for embedding usebrick.dev tools in other pipelines. |

### Why unscoped `slopbrick` (not `@usebrick/slopbrick`)

Per a design-review call: **libraries use the `@usebrick/` scope; the flagship CLI stays unscoped**.

- `npx slopbrick` is shorter and more memorable than `npx @usebrick/slopbrick`
- The CLI is what most users touch; the library boundary is a developer concern
- Future CLIs (`usebrick` umbrella for `usebrick scan` / `usebrick structure` / `usebrick doctor`) can grow under a separate brand without crowding the `@usebrick/` scope
- Scope is for libraries that get `import`ed. The CLI gets `npx`'d.

So:

```
slopbrick              ← the CLI (this monorepo, published)
@usebrick/core         ← the schema + readers (workspace-only for now)
@usebrick/engine       ← the pure scanning engine (workspace-only, new in v0.15.0)
@usebrick/mcp          ← future: standalone MCP server (library)
@usebrick/sdk          ← future: programmatic SDK (library)
```

## Why one monorepo

The platform's tools all share:

- **Repository Structure Platform schema** (`.slopbrick/inventory.json`, `constitution.json`, `structure.md`, `health.json`)
- **AST models** (React, Vue, Svelte, Astro, HTML visitors)
- **MCP contracts** (slop_suggest, slop_suggest_with_structure, slop_check_constitution, slop_find_similar)
- **Test fixtures + corpus**
- **Calibration pipeline** (recall/FP ratio per rule)
- **Release cadence** (slopbrick releases today; future tools will share the version stream)

Splitting these into separate repos would create constant synchronization work. The monorepo keeps them in lock-step.

## Quick start (for contributors)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm -r build         # build @usebrick/core → @usebrick/engine → slopbrick → website
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm -r test
```

## Future package extractions

Two extractions are tracked but **not done yet**:

- `packages/structure/` (or `packages/repository-structure/`) — when the structure module outgrows the schema. See [`docs/future-extractions.md`](./docs/future-extractions.md).
- `packages/contracts/` — when a non-TypeScript consumer needs the schemas (Python stackpick analyzer, Go CI binary). At that point, `contracts/` becomes the language-agnostic spec, `core/` becomes the TypeScript implementation.

---

## Release cadence

- **`slopbrick`** — published on npm. Bumps the patch version for fixes, minor for new scores/rules, major for breaking scan output changes.
- **`@usebrick/core`** — private for now. When published, every slopbrick release that depends on a schema bump will release a matching `@usebrick/core` major version bump.
- **`@usebrick/engine`** — workspace-only. Tracks slopbrick version in lock-step.
- **`@usebrick/website`** — workspace-only. Deployed to GitHub Pages on `main` when `packages/website/**` changes.
